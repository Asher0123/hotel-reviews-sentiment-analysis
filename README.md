# hotel-reviews-sentiment-analysis

This project performs multi-class sentiment analysis on over 500,000 hotel reviews to predict reviewer sentiment (Negative, Neutral, Positive) using classical NLP techniques. Review text is formed by combining positive and negative review sections and represented using TF-IDF n-gram features, with the VADER compound score added as an auxiliary sentiment prior. Sentiment labels are derived from numeric reviewer scores, and model performance is evaluated using macro F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC–AUC due to strong class imbalance. Logistic Regression and LinearSVC are compared, with LinearSVC selected as the final model for its more balanced class separation, particularly for neutral reviews. The project highlights the challenges of mixed-polarity text, neutral sentiment ambiguity, and demonstrates why linear models with sparse text features remain strong, interpretable baselines for large-scale sentiment analysis.
